```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv add spotipy flask python-dotenv

# Or using pip
pip install spotipy flask python-dotenv
```

### 3. Configuration

```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your Spotify credentials:
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/callback
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here_change_this_to_something_secure
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Dashboard with user profile and playlists
- `GET /login` - Initiate Spotify OAuth
- `GET /callback` - OAuth callback handler
- `GET /logout` - Logout and clear session
- `GET /analyze_playlist/<id>` - Analyze a specific playlist
- `POST /create_genre_playlists/<id>` - Create genre-based playlists
- `POST /filter_genre` - Create filtered playlist
- `POST /remove_duplicates/<id>` - Remove duplicate tracks
- `GET /api/playlist/<id>/genres` - JSON API for genre data

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Uses Spotify's OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
2. **Genre Detection**: Analyzes track artists to determine genres using Spotify's genre data
3. **Categorization**: Groups tracks by their primary genres
4. **Playlist Creation**: Uses Spotify's API to create new playlists and add tracks

## Limitations

- Genre detection depends on Spotify's genre data for artists
- Some tracks may not have clear genre information
- Rate limiting applies based on Spotify's API limits
- Requires active internet connection

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Check your Spotify Client ID and Secret
- Ensure redirect URI matches exactly: `http://localhost:5000/callback`
- Make sure your Spotify app is not in development mode restrictions

### "No genres found"
- Some tracks may not have genre information in Spotify's database
- This is normal for very new releases or obscure artists

### App running slowly
- Genre analysis can take time for large playlists
- The app processes tracks in batches to respect API limits
